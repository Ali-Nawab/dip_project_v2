The previous version of handwritten digit recognition have many limitation which reduces its efficiency. In this version, 
we will try to cover all the limitation and makes it robust.

We will cover following aspects in this version:

1) Algorithm can detect noisy images.
2) Algorithm can also detect digits on RGB images.
3) Algorithm will be trained on large number of dataset including MNIST, SVHN dataset and also include Data Augmentation. 
We will also made some dataset by ourself to trained algorithm on it.
4) We will also include Transfer Learning in t.
5) Algorithm will be Robust and efficient.
